# TILEMAP

A tilemap is a single image containing a grid of sprites for each tile. A sprite is rendered by specifying the pixel offset, height, and width in code.

## Specification
* Each sprite is a 16x16 pixel bitmap.
* A row represents a single archetype of entity (e.g., item, monster, character).
* The archetype order follows the enum order specified in archetype.js.
* Only static tiles are stored in the tilemap. Animations are specified elsewhere.
